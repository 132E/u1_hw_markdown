### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as
bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

It is the primary language that ReadMe files are written in.  A ReadMe file usually contains a description of the project, or instructions on how to get started, or both! This lesson is a ReadMe file.  The ` .md ` at the end of the file stands for **M**ark**D**own!
